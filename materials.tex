\need{Inference}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Use robust standard errors, but do not cluster on the running variable if it is discrete (\cite{kolesar})!

\need{How the Pros Do It}
\begin{itemize}
\item See \cite{cattaneo} for ways to optimally select the bandwidth.
\item Verify results are not sensitive to bandwidth or choice of $g(w)$.
\item If there are characteristics that should not be changed by the treatment (e.g. pre-treatment demographics), try putting them on the left hand side and show there is no change at the cutoff.
\item Controlling for unit characteristics may increase precision even if they do not change at the cutoff.
\item Using polynomials higher than order 2 for $g(w)$ is generally frowned upon (\cite{gelman}). Try a local linear regression or lower order polynomial instead!
    \end{itemize}

\need{Make it Sizzle}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Do you observe periods before and after the cutoff rule was in place? If so, you may be able to estimate the elusive ``diff-in-diff-RD'' model!
    \item Do this estimating $\beta_{RDD}$ using data from prior to when the cutoff was instituted, and then again after the cutoff was instituted. 
\end{itemize}
